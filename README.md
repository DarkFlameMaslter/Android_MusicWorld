Just an application for music listening on Android

Yep it seem to be true! That it!
Simple design but functions had been invested by all my heart!
If you have a bit knowledge on coding and some more effort in research then this project is perfectly fine for your starting line in a music app android and much more after.

Quick tutorial here:
- Find out what is restAPI and retrofit
- Have some basic nodejs knowledge and how to add Express
- What is json, request, types of them and body of a request (sometime informations are stored in the url in my case so you need to deal with that too)
- Have some code test and tweak my codes for experiences. It's good for you (as a coder i gave you a advice like that)
- When you think you can able to re-create my project without a doub then you re good to go! ^^ 
- Thanks for reading these!



What is inside my app?
3 Main function:
- Play music
- Download Music to server
- Upload Music to server

Not counting the very first basic function (play music). The two other is the point. Not just music, it could be a paragraph, a picture, a letter, a video or a file. No mather what it is. When you mastered these functions, i belive you shall have tons of idea pop-up inside your mind!

To know how them work, read this part:
- For Music Player, check for the Library Activity and find out how i got the whole list of song inside your device. You will need to know about Cursor and permission stuff. 
- Recycler view knowledge is a MUST HAVE in this project, not because of it characteristic but my functions are deployed in those Recycle View so if you have any problem with UI and functions, you would know where to fix it.
- Download music of files seem to be really hard when you new to restAPI but trust me, the developers of retrofit and Express had take a long road before us and now those problem is easy like a piece of cake. Your problem is now thinking about where to download okey. Mine is simple with some basic setup on SQL and few lines of code to pop those out.
- Same as Download, upload would be a combine of 2 problem above. How to find files in your device and send it to server. My server is even more simple than the app but the functions is working good on it. My recommend is find a better way to handle those uploaded file and also do some Queue to SQL for next time using download function (You would understand when you understand those server code)
